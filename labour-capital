Given this, it is perhaps not surprising that dividend payments have particularly taken off since the “shareholder revolution” of the 1980s, which empowered investors and management ',

During 2000-19 it grew 5.5x faster. If worker compensation and dividend payments had grown at an equal pace over 1988-2019 (i.e. at 1.9 per cent per year each, instead of the 4.2 per cent for dividends vs 1.6 per cent for pay that actually transpired), then hourly labour compensation would have been 8.9 per cent greater going into the pandemic. Only since the onset of the gas crisis of 2022 has pay fared better than dividends.'
